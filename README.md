The following design patterns were implemented in the Facebook Desktop App:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Separates the application's concerns.
- **Facade:** Simplifies interaction with complex subsystems.
- **Factory Method:** Creates instances of dependent objects.
- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Strategy:** Encapsulates algorithms to be interchangeable.
- **Observer:** Notifies subscribers of changes in state.
- **Command:** Encapsulates a request as an object.
